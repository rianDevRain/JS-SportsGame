 Assessment for Kenzie
Game Instructions
How should this game work?
<br>
1.  Clicking either "SHOOT" button represents a shot for that team.
*  Shots should have a random chance of succeeding or failing. (Sounds like Internet research time! How do you determine a random chance in JavaScript?)
*  The number of shots taken should increase for every click of the "SHOOT" button.
*  The number of goals should only increase when the shot is successful.
2.  Clicking the "RESET" button should reset all the shot and goal counters and add 1 to the number of resets.
#  Bonus
1.  Play a sound when someone clicks the "Shoot" button. You'll need to read about the `<audio>` element and how to use it in JS. You will also need to find a sound file to use.
2.  Use what you know about HTML and CSS to make the page look better!
3.  Upon reset, display who won the game.
